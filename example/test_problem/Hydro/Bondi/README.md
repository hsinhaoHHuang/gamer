# Default setup
1. Units:
   1. External (for `Input__TestProb` only):
      | [L] | [Dens] | [Mass] | [Temp] |
      |---  |---     |---     |---     |
      | kpc | g/cm^3 | Msun   | keV    |

   2. Internal (for all other input files and internal usage):
      | [L] | [V]      | [Dens]         | [Time] = [L]/[V]      | [Mass] = [Dens]*[L]^3 |
      |---  |---       |---             |---                    |---                    |
      | kpc | 1e3 km/s | 5.0e-25 g/cm^3 | ~ 0.978 Myr ~ 1.0 Myr | ~ 7.4e6 Msun          |

2. Gravity dt is disabled by setting [[DT__GRAVITY | Runtime-Parameters:-Timestep#DT__GRAVITY]] to arbitrarily large
3. [[MIN_PRES | Hydro#MIN_PRES]] = 1.0e-16


# Note
1. Dual-energy formalism is important for evolving pressure accurately in the
   high Mach number region (e.g., when Mach number is greater than ~10)
   --> Especially important for small [[GAMMA | Hydro#GAMMA]] and large [[MAX_LEVEL | Runtime-Parameters:-Refinement#MAX_LEVEL]]
2. The gnuplot script `plot_diagonal.gpt` plots the simulation results along the diagonal
   and compare to the analytical solutions. The script `plot_profile.gpt` plots the
   shell-average profiles generated by `gamer_extract_profile`.
3. By default it runs only for 10 Bondi time. One may need to run for a longer time in order
   to get the velocity field converge to the analytical solution at larger radii.
4. The contents of the file `Input__Flag_User` are not used actually.
5. For large [[MAX_LEVEL | Runtime-Parameters:-Refinement#MAX_LEVEL]] (e.g., 11),
   using [[OPT__DT_LEVEL | Runtime-Parameters:-Timestep#OPT__DT_LEVEL ]] = 3 for the first step may result in
   unphysical results since the time-step would likely be over-estimated due to both the
   zero initial velocity and the disabling of [[DT__GRAVITY | Runtime-Parameters:-Timestep#DT__GRAVITY]].
> [!NOTE]
> It's better to adopt [[OPT__DT_LEVEL | Runtime-Parameters:-Timestep#OPT__DT_LEVEL ]] = 2 and
> small [[DT__FLUID_INIT| Runtime-Parameters:-Timestep#DT__FLUID_INIT]] for the first step,
> dump data, and then restart with [[OPT__DT_LEVEL | Runtime-Parameters:-Timestep#OPT__DT_LEVEL ]] = 3.
